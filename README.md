### League of Legends Memory Card Game ###
Simple memory game using League of Legends characters. 

The goal is to clilck on each character once , if clicked on twice your score will reset back to zero and you'll have to start over.

Not every character from LoL is in the game. A total of 143 different characters will show up everytime the page is refreshed !

### What I learned ###
I learned about diffrent types of shuffling algorithims. The one used here is the fischer-yates shuffle, which to my newly gained knowledge is the most ideal/random shuffle to use. 

My knowledge about states and props in react also grew and I have a better understanding of how to structure a react application.

I got the list of character names by using an api at first as I was really trying to force api usage, but literally all I needed was the names and the application would be 50/50 on whether it would succesfully get the API or not. I found this to be very annoying/confusing and decided to scrap the api so I could actually work on the project.
